## Inspiration:

The first time I hosted a Toastmasters Meeting, I was only a member for 1 month. At the end of every speech given, the host is supposed to remind the audience to fill out feedback notes to give to the speaker. When I was reminding them to do so, I couldn’t remember that feedback notes were called feedback notes and in my panic, I blurted out the first thing that vaguely made sense: Love Notes. The new name stuck and all feedback notes are now called Love Notes.
LoveNotes is an app designed to help the Toastmaster’s membership pass around speech feedback during their meetings. Covid-19 has forced many clubs to run “hybrid” meetings where some members are meeting in person along with other members joining the meeting through virtual means. Because of this, membership has found it difficult to figure out a simple method for their members to pass around feedback notes. This app was designed to offer that solution. The app facilitates the exchange by allowing feedback users to easily connect with speakers and sends notes. The app will then store the notes for the speaker to review.
